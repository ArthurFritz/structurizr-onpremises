## Authorisation

By default, all workspaces are accessible by anybody who has access to your Structurizr installation.
Anonymous users (not signed in) have read-only access, while authenticated users (signed in) have read-write access.
Workspace access can be configured via the [workspace settings page](https://structurizr.com/help/workspace-settings).
You can also configure the set of users when creating your model as text (Structurizr DSL, via [users](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl/blob/master/docs/language-reference.md#users)) or code (i.e. the Structurizr client libraries).

The security of each workspace is summarised on the dashboard with the following labels:

| Icon | Description |
| - | - |
| ![](images/public.png) | Public (accessible to everybody) |
| ![](images/private.png) | Private (accessible only to specified users/roles) |
